# SafeTravels
SafeTravels was developed with road tripping in mind, and is a great way to keep friends and loved ones updated with your location along the way, but the application could be used in any case where the user would like to send location updates to somebody with a smart phone. SafeTravels could be also be used to monitor the location of your children, making sure a loved one arrives home safely, or just for fun!

The application allows the user to enter a mobile contact from their list of contacts and a time interval in which SMS messages will be sent out with location updates. Location updates will continue until the user clicks 'STOP' or until the application is terminated.

### Key Functionality
*  Continues sending location updates while app is in the background, so there is no need to keep it open after you start. Keep your eyes on the road!!!
*  A custom LocationService class was implemented to update the location only when necessary in order to maximize battery life.
*  Sends location updates as SMS messages with a google maps URL so anybody with a smart phone can receive the updates.
*  Simple, lightweight, and very easy to use

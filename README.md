# SafeTravels
SafeTravels was developed with road tripping in mind, but could be used in any case where you would like to send location updates to somebody with a smart phone.
The application allows the user to enter a mobile contact from their contacts list and a time interval to send out SMS messages with location updates. Updates will continue until the user clicks 'STOP' or until the application is killed.

### Key Functionality
*  Continues sending location updates while app is in the background
*  Custom LocationService class to update location only when needed to maximize battery life
*  Sends SMS messages with a google maps URL, so anybody with a smart phone can receive updates
*  Simple and lightweight
